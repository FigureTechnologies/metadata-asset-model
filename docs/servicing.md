<a name="tech.figure.servicing.v1beta1.Allocation"></a>

### Allocation
Used to track loan balances and how LedgerEntries break down into various types
"owed" may be thought of as debits
"applied" may be thought of as credits
Note: both owed and applied are typically positive, with the exception of reversals and adjustments
Exception: Credit owed to the borrower / held for the borrower is negative (ex: escrow balance)
Note: "bucket" is used interchangeably with Allocation and AllocationType


| Field | Type | Label | Description |

| amount_owed | [tech.figure.util.v1beta1.Money](util#tech.figure.util.v1beta1.Money) |  | Balance owed - if LedgerEntry adjustment, alters owed amounts without appearing as if a payment were made (no change to applied) |
